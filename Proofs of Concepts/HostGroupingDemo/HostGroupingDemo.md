 # Host Grouping GUI demo
 ## Problem definition
 The GUI is easy to use and more informative, but it can be somewhat tedious when doing repetitive procedures. Here, we are tying to explore how much the GUI can be useful, easy to use while providing the most amount of flexibility and allowing most test cases to be created.
 A scripting interface is still needed but this demo intends to explore the limits of a GUI as it is more favorable.

 ## Implementation
 QT is a C++ framework provides excellent GUI features and flexible interfaces. In this implementation, devices in the system and their properties will be always viewable on the left section of the screen. A user is able to create any number of streams and modify them. each stream has two groups of devices (generators and verifiers) and packet details. Adding devices to the two lists is done by selecting them from the left section, then clicking add under the intended list.
